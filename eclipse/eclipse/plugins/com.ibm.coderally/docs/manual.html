<h2>Welcome to CodeRally!</h2>

<P>
CodeRally gives you the opportunity to pit your Java programming skills against other teams in a world
of car rally racing. Each team will write a Java 
class which represents and controls a <I>RallyCar</I>. Your car (class) will be placed on a 
simulated race track along with cars from other teams.
</P>

<P>
Rally cars can move around on a track and obtain important 
information such as the location of various objects on the track and the current 
capabilities of other cars. Cars 
can collide with other cars, throw spare tires to distract other cars, and they 
can enter a protected mode to (temporarily) protect themselves from being hurt 
by other cars.
</P>

<P>
The rally pits cars against each other in a series of matches. A match consists of up to 
six cars competing with each other. Each car starts a match positioned in a random location and facing a 
random direction on a finite two-dimensional grid, with the same amount of fuel 
and spare tires as the other cars. Driving around the track uses fuel. The track contains places where cars 
can go to get additional fuel and different places they can go to pick up spare 
tires. If a car runs out of fuel it can no longer move, so it is important to constantly check your fuel and refuel 
if necessary.
</P>

<P>
During each match, a car can accumulate “points.” Cars can 
earn points in four ways: by successfully throwing a spare tire at another car, 
by passing checkpoints in order or out of order around the track, and by the 
amount of fuel remaining at the end of a match. Cars with the highest 
point totals from each match advance to subsequent rounds.
</P>

<P>
The rest of this guide shows how to create a car and how to invoke its various capabilities.
You should work now to understand the code structure that your car must implement, and discuss
the strategy for your car to use during the game. It is permissible for players to openly discuss code
structure and strategy during this time.
</p>

<p>
The coding part of the CodeRally starts when you get access to your machine. You will use the Eclipse
development environment to create and test your car. You must use Eclipse to develop your car 
code, since the simulated track runs under Eclipse.
</p>

<p>
You can test your car during the coding phase in two ways. First, there will be a private version
of the track environment on your machine. The private track contains a collection of sample cars
with various capabilities (but no cars from other teams). You may run your car on this private 
track to see how it performs. Only you will be able to see the results of running your car on the private 
track.
</P>

<p>
The second way to test a car is to submit it to the public CodeRally track. When you 
submit your car to the public track, you will obtain a snapshot on your machine 
of all other cars that have been submitted up to that point in time. You will be 
able to run a public version of the CodeRally track to watch the performance of your car 
against other player's submitted cars (and vice versa).
</p>

<p>
The performance of your car on the public track during the coding phase does not count.
It is strictly an opportunity for you to see how your car performs against other player's
cars in order to consider making changes.
</p>

<p>
It is not a requirement to submit your car to the public track during coding phase. However, 
all teams must submit their final cars prior to the end of the coding phase to be included in
the final tournament.</P>

<p>
The final versions of all cars (the last submission you make) 
will compete in a tournament which will take place [**]. The cars will initially be grouped randomly
into matches with up to five other cars. After each round, cars will be regrouped according to the
points they accumulate and a new round will begin.</P>

<p>
All cars will compete in at least three rounds. After that, 
eliminations will take place based on points and a new series of rounds will 
begin. Each car will start each new series of rounds with zero points and random regrouping.
The winning car will be will be the player whose car earns the most points in the final tournament 
round.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of this guide is intended to help you understand how to design and implement your car.
JavaDoc files are also available, describing the classes and interfaces that relate to coding your car.
</p>

<p><center><b>Good luck in the CodeRally!</b></center></p>

<h2>Coding Your Car – Overview</h2>

<p>When you start Eclipse on your machine and open the CodeRally project, you will find a skeleton for the class
<span class="code">RallyCar.java</span>. This is the class that will contain the code making up your car.
You may add fields and declare additional methods, as well as create other Java classes.</P>

<p>The RallyCar class contains stubs for certain methods required in cars; you will have to fill 
in the code in these methods. Modifying these methods is the primary manner in which you create the 
“personality” of your car. You may also add other fields and methods to the RallyCar
class to further define its characteristics.</P>

<p>When you have a version of the RallyCar class that you wish to test in the private track, save your RallyCar
code and then click the “Run the private track” button on the Eclipse toolbar, which has the following icon:

<img src="images/test.gif" width=16 height=16 hspace=2 vspace=2/>

(Note: this icon has a red checkered flag in it; don’t confuse it with the other similar icon which has a green
checkered flag.) If you are not sure about the function of an icon, move the mouse over it to see a ToolTip display of its 
function.
</P>

<p>
When you wish to submit your RallyCar to the public track, save your code and click the “Submit the code” button on 
the Eclipse toolbar, which has the following icon

<img src="images/submit.gif" width=16 height=16 hspace=2 vspace=2/>.</P>

<p>
Once you have submitted your car to the public track, you can 
run your car in the public track and view its performance against other 
submitted cars. To run the public track, click the “Run the public track” button, which has the following icon:

<img src="images/tournament.gif" width=16 height=16 hspace=2 vspace=2/>

(Note: this icon has a green checkered flag in it; 
don’t confuse it with the other similar icon which has a red checkered flag.)
</p>

<p>
The class Car.java is the superclass of RallyCar. It defines a number of methods that are 
inherited by RallyCar. These methods can be extremely useful in controlling your car.
</p>

<p>
You should not modify anything in the Car class. In fact, when you run your car, it will actually run with a different 
version of the Car class from the one you see in your environment. In particular, the Car
class you will see contains some dummy initialization and return value code that 
will be replaced when you run in the private or public track.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the above classes, your environment will contain three Java interfaces that
define the interfaces presented by various components of the track:
</p>

<ul>
<li>IObject.java
<p/>
<p>
This is the interface of all objects in the simulated track. Every object implements this 
interface, which declares methods getX() and getY() 
that return the location of the object on the track. All track coordinates are non-negative 
values of type double.
</p>
</li>

<li>ISpareTire.java
<p>
This interface extends IObject and defines the interface of all spare tires that are currently active in the 
simulated track. Every spare tire implements this interface, which declares methods getHeading()
and getSpeed(). Thus every spare tire contains methods 
that allow cars to determine important characteristics of the spare tire as the 
tire moves across the track.
</p>
</li>

<li>ICar.java
<p>
This interface extends IObject and defines the interface for all cars on the simulated track.
Thus it defines methods your car can invoke either on itself or on an opponent’s car. These
methods are described in further detail below and in the JavaDocs for the CodeRally environment.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The CodeRally Track Simulation</h2>
<h3>Identification</h3>
<p>
There are three method stubs in the RallyCar class that your team must fill in to identify your car. The first is 
getSchoolName(), which must return a string of no more than 25 characters giving the name of your 
School or University. Cars that do not assign their school name in getSchoolName() will not be allowed to
compete in the tournament.
</p>

<p>
The second required identification method is getName(),
which must return a string of no more than 25 characters assigning a name to your car. You may choose any name
you wish for your car, but inappropriate names may be modified or the car may be eliminated.
</p>

<p>The third identification method is getColor(),
which must return a byte constant chosen from the predefined car colors given in 
the Car class. You can use this method to assign a color to your car, which determines its appearance in the graphical 
display of the CodeRally environment. The default value returned by getColor() is CAR_BLUE.</P>

<p>
The identification methods must not do any computations other than returning the specified constant values.
</p>

<h3>Initialization</h3>
<p>
When your car is placed into a track, the simulator invokes the initialize() method in your car. Put any 
initialization code you want to have executed into this method. You may make use of the entire API at 
this time. Be aware that the simulator will provide only a limited amount of time (1 second) for your 
initialization code to execute before it begins the game. If your initialization code fails to 
complete within the time limit, your car will enter the track in an uninitialized state, with unpredictable results.
</p>

<h3>Moving Your Car</h3>
<p>
Once the simulator finishes its timed calls to each car’s 
initialize() routine, it calls the move() method in each car in sequential 
order. This happens once every clock tick. The code in your car’s move()
method determines what actions it takes during the course of a game. In addition to the input parameters to move(), 
which give some status information, methods are available to your car to query 
its own status, to change variables such as the desired direction and speed at 
which it should move, to query the status of other cars, to find the location of 
objects on the track (for example, the gas stations which can be used to refuel 
or places where you can pick up spare tires), and to throw spare tires from your 
car.
</p>

<p>
move() has four parameters that provide information about what happened during the
<I>previous</I> movement cycle. These parameters specify (1) how much 
time (in milliseconds) your move() method used the previous time it was 
called; (2) whether your car hit a wall during the previous cycle, (3) 
whether your car collided with another car during the previous cycle, and (4) 
whether your car was hit by a spare tire from another car during the previous 
cycle. The first parameter is an int, the second is a boolean, 
the third and fourth parameters are an ICar reference to the corresponding car (or null, if no collision or hit 
occurred). The first parameter is useful in determining whether your car is in danger of exceeding the maximum 
amount of time allowed to complete a move.
</p>

<h3>CodeRally Track Details</h3>
<p>
A CodeRally track is a two-dimensional world of 1010 units in X by 580 units in Y, <i>with the origin in the top left 
corner</i>. There is a wall around the outside edge of the track, and cars cannot go beyond the wall.
There are no walls on the interior of the world. Cars can move freely about the world, unless they bump into another 
car. Objects move in directions called <i>headings</i>, which are measured in integer degrees. Zero degrees 
is “straight up”. All headings are positive numbers in the range 0..359 and increase in the clockwise direction.
</p>
<p>
The figure below describes the world:
</P>

<img src="images/world.gif" width=328 height=235 hspace=10 vspace=10/>

<p/>

<p>
The world has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The world is driven by a ticking clock whose value can be read using getClockTicks().</li>

<li>Each car starts the match with 100 fuel units and 3 spare tires.</li>

<li>Setting steering and throttle causes a car to 
move continuously with those settings until it is instructed to do otherwise, 
although it may be blocked by walls or other cars.</li>

<li>Cars can change throttle and steering instantaneously. Speed and direction will not change
instantaneously because the cars have inertia.
</li>

<li>The minimum throttle of a car (MIN_THROTTLE) is -50 units and the maximum throttle (MAX_THROTTLE) 
is 100; the maximum rate of change of speed from a stopped position (except in collisions) is 8 units per tick.
</li>

<li>The minimum steering setting (MAX_STEER_LEFT) is -10, and the maximum steering setting (MAX_STEER_RIGHT) 
is 10. The rate of change of heading is dependant on speed and can be found via the getChangeInHeading() 
method.
</li>

<li>The location of a car on the track is a point. Cars are 60 units long and 40 units wide, centered at their location.
</li>

<li>To keep the detection of a round spare tire hitting a rectangular car simple, a spare tire will hit a
car when its location passes within 40 units of the car’s location.
</li>

<li>Spare tires thrown by a car move at a constant 
velocity of 12 units per tick until they hit a car or a wall, at which time they 
disappear. Checkpoints, fuel depots, and spare tire depots do not affect spare 
tires as they move across the world. Spare tires do not hit each other if they 
pass over the same location.
</li>

<li>The maximum amount of fuel a car can have is 100 units.
</li>

<li>The maximum number of spare tires a car can have is 5.
</li>

<li>Whenever a car’s location is within 25 units of a 
fuel depot, the car’s fuel is increased at a constant rate of 1 unit per clock 
tick up to the maximum. There are 3 randomly placed fuel depots during each 
match.
</li>

<li>Whenever a car’s location is within 25 units of a 
spare tire depot, and the car has less than 5 spare tires, the car will pick up 
a spare tire every 5 clock ticks. There are 3 randomly placed spare tire depots 
during each match.
</li>

<li>Cars can protect themselves against collisions 
with spare tires or other cars by entering “protect mode”. A car moving in protect mode consumes 
fuel at twice the normal rate. Protect mode lasts for 50 clock ticks.</li>

<li>Colliding with another car will cause your momentum to be transferred to the other car and both cars
will loose 10 fuel units.
</li>

<li>Throwing a spare tire and successfully hitting 
another car will increase your points by 10. The car that is hit will loose 10 fuel units, its move()
method will not be called for 10 clock ticks, and it will be pushed in the 
direction that the spare tire was traveling. You will not get any points for hitting a 
car which is in protected mode, nor will it affect that other car.</li>

<li>Once a car throws a spare tire, that car will be 
unable to throw another spare tire for 25 clock ticks from the time the tire was 
thrown.</li>

<li>The time limit to complete a single move is 500 
milliseconds. If a car’s move() method does not return within 500 milliseconds of the time when it is called, 
the move() will not be called again for the rest of the match and the most recent steering 
and throttle settings will be maintained.</li>

<li>There are a number of ordered checkpoints placed in a route on each track. Passing 
within 25 units of any checkpoint will give you 2 points, but going to the next 
successive checkpoint will give you 6 points. Returning to the same checkpoint 
twice in a row will not give you any points.</li>

<li>Points are earned according to the following table. Remember that it is total points earned that
determines which cars advance during elimination rounds.

<table cellSpacing=2 cellPadding=1 border=0>
 <tr>
  <td><b>Action</b></td>
  <td><b>Points Earned</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Passing any checkpoint</td>
  <td>2</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Passing a checkpoint in successive order</td>
  <td>6</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Hitting another car with a spare tire</td>
  <td>10</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>For each 10 units of fuel left after a match</td>
  <td>1</td>
 </tr>
</table>
</li>

</ul>

<h3>General Information, Caveats, Constraints, and Restrictions</h3>

<ul>

<li>The Java JRE being use for CodeRally is version 1.4.1.</li>

<li>Cars may not define any constructors.</li>

<li>Cars may not use static initialization blocks to 
initialize their cars.</li>

<li>All the Java code for your car must be contained 
within the RallyCar class.</li>

<li>Cars may not create their own threads, processes, 
print jobs, files, or other similar system functions.</li>

<li>Cars may use System.out.println() 
to display information on the Eclipse console, but the time it takes to do this 
is charged against the car’s move() time limit. (Actions like this are relatively time-consuming.)</li>

<li>You may run the simulation in Java debug mode. However, understand that when running either the 
private or public worlds in debug mode, all move and initialization time limits 
are automatically turned off. If your moves are taking a long time, you should 
test your car in run mode to ensure that it is not going over the time 
limits.</li>

<li>You may not talk to anyone other than your own 
team members once the coding phase of the CodeRally starts.</li>

<li>Any player that submits a car containing code deemed to be intentionally designed
to damage the CodeRally environment will be disqualified.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Example RallyCar Code</h2>
<p>The following code snippets show simple examples of various 
operations which might be used inside a move() method. Note that <I>these are separate code snippets</I>, not a 
single complete move() method. Note also that these are only examples, intended to give you an idea of how to do
things within your car. Winning cars will undoubtedly utilize sophisticated strategies which take full advantage
of the range of method calls available to them.</p>

<p>
The list of methods available to cars is documented in the JavaDoc descriptions of the classes and interfaces of 
the CodeRally environment. The primary challenge in the CodeRally is for you to decide on a strategy which uses the
available methods to optimum advantage for your car.</p>
